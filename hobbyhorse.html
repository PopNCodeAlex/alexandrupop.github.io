            <h3>Why a skating application?(Purpose of the project)</h3>
            <p>
              The app targets skaters without a suitable skating pal. It helps
              skaters find skating outings no matter the skating style they
              practice and their experience. Moreover, there is no need for
              skaters to manually search and reach out to others, because the
              app does that for the skaters, it creates an "event" and all
              suitable skaters are invited. A skater can register and create
              multiple profiles that are linked to an account, one for each
              existing skating style one might practice:
              <b>casual skating</b>, <b>street skating</b>,
              <b>speed skating</b>. A user can suggest their location and time
              availability along with other skating preferences through the
              creation of a 'schedule'. This allows the app to automatically
              create events with skaters that match.

            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>
              The frontend is created with <b>React Native Expo</b>, the library
              used for some of the components and styling is React Native Paper.
              The authentication is implemented through Firebase Authentication.
              The backend has a microservices architecture. The two services, a
              RESTful API and a Worker Service, communicate through asynchronous
              channels. The processing required for the automatic event
              generation is handled by the worker service. Some of the
              processign jobs that reach the API (since the frontend
              communicates only with the API) are passed to the worker service.

                  In the profile section skaters can add for each skating
                  profile a set of skills along with their mastery level. This
                  would help the application provide one the best event
                  suggestions with skaters that would make their time
                  worthwhile.
