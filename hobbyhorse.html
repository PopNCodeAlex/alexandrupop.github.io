            <h3>Why a skating application?</h3>
            <p>
              The app targets skaters without a suitable skating pal. It helps
              skaters find skating outings no matter the skating style they
              practice and their experience. Moreover, there is no need for
              skaters to manually search and reach out to others. HobbyHorse
              automatically creates "events" and all suitable skaters get an
              invite.
            </p>

            <h3>How does the app work?</h3>
            <p>
              A skater can register and create multiple profiles that are linked
              to an account, one for each existing skating style one might
              practice: <b>casual skating</b>, <b>street skating</b>,
              <b>speed skating</b>. A user can suggest their location and time
              availability along with other skating preferences through the
              creation of a 'schedule'. This is required for the auto generation
              of events.

                  This screen shows the steps one takes to suggest their time
                  and location availabilty. They are also prompted to select age
                  and gender preferences. All this is taken into account when
                  events are created.

                  In the profile section skaters can add for each skating
                  profile a set of skills along with their mastery level. This
                  would help the application provide one the best event
                  suggestions with skaters that would make their time
                  worthwhile.

            <h4>Project Structure and Technology Stack Overview</h4>
            <p>
              The frontend is created with <b>React Native Expo</b>, the library
              used for some of the components and styling is React Native Paper.
              The authentication is implemented through Firebase Authentication.
              The backend has a microservices architecture. The two services, a
              RESTful API and a Worker Service, communicate through asynchronous
              channels. The processing required for the automatic event
              generation is handled by the worker service. Some of the
              processing jobs that reach the API (since the frontend
              communicates only with the API) are passed to the worker service.
